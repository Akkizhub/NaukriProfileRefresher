### Selenium and Python powered automation script

This script automates information updates on the job portal "Naukri". Most recruiters may filter users with the most recent updates on their profile.

Use this script to update your Naukri Profile on schedule every day; this can be completed in seconds.

In order to use this, you need Git, Python 3, and Google Chrome on your machine.


## Installation

Install [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/getit/) and run the below commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/navchandar/Naukri.git
cd Naukri
pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m venv .venv              # create virtual environment for installing dependencies
./.venv/bin/activate.ps1           # source ./.venv/bin/activate  # command for macOS/linux
pip install -r requirements.txt    # Install dependencies
```

Configuration: Update `RESUME_PATH`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, and `MOBILE` directly in `constants.py` before running the script.
